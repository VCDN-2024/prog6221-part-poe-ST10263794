Lecturer's feedback: 

App Functionality: The user can enter calories and a food group for each ingredient
Feedback: an explanation should be shown to the user of what these values mean
My response: When entering ingredients, the application now includes an explanation of what the calories and food group values mean. This helps users understand the nutritional impact and classification of each ingredient.

App Functionality: The total calories of a recipe is calculated and displayed
Feedback: an explanation should be included that is specific to certain ranges of calories
My response: An additional feature was added to provide specific explanations based on certain ranges of total calories. For example, if a recipe's total calories exceed 300, a warning is displayed, informing the user about the high calorie content and suggesting moderation.
